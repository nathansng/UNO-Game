# UNO-Game

**December 9, 2020**

Second day of working on project. Finished project, able to play the game with others. 

After working on this short side project for a couple of days, I was able to finish the game using object oriented programming. By using objects to represent the cards, decks, and discard pile, I was able to combine the objects to create a functioning text game. Although its use and capabailities are limited, this is only meant for practicing my code and using GitHub. 

Some things I might change for a future project would be to learn more about adding multiplayer functionalities instead of having to play on the same device. I would also add graphics to make the game more visually appealing and understandable.

Begin working on an UNO based programmig project. First upload to GitHub. 

This side project is meant to be a practice in making an UNO type like game. Used for practicing my Python skills and using Jupyter Notebooks. 

The goal of this project is to make a working text-based uno game that is playable with any number of people locally.
